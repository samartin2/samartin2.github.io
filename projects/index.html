    <p><strong>Computational Characterization of Thermal Processes in an
        AlN:Mo Susceptor in a Millimeter Wave Heat Exchanger</strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em></p>
    <p>In this work, we develop a computational model to simulate EM and thermal processes in
        a simplifed MMW heat exchanger and examine different ceramic materials to find the one that
        maximizes the device's efficiency. EM and EM-thermal coupled problems are solved by the finite-
        difference time-domain (FDTD) technique (implemented in <i>QuickWave</i>) for a block of AlN:Mo
        composite that is backed by a thin metal plate and irradiated by a MMW plane wave. Computation
        is based on experimental data on temperature-dependent dielectric constant, loss factor, specific
        heat, and thermal conductivity. In addition to the case of full thermal insulation of the ceramic
        block (Neumann scenario), with a Dirichlet boundary condition on the surface between the metal
        plate and the ceramic block, we imitate a special operational regime in which the metal plate is
        maintained at a constant temperature to prevent the ceramic block from overheating.</p>
    <p>The FDTD model is verified by solving the underlying EM problem by the finite-element sim-
        ulator, <i>COMSOLMultiphysics</i>. It is shown that in the considered scenario with the Dirichlet
        boundary condition, accuracy of the iterative FDTD solution of the coupled EM-thermal problem
        strongly depends on the heating time step: maintaining a high temperature on the interface with
        the metal plate triggers higher levels of non-uniformity of temperature fields and requires a smaller
        time step to achieve a sufficient level of adequacy. It is shown that, at 95 GHz, 10x10x10 mm
        blocks with Mo contents from 0.25 to 4% can be heated up to 1,000 C highly uniformly for 60-95s,
        depending on the percentage of Mo. The composite producing the highest level of total dissipated
        power in both the Neumann and Dirichlet scenarios is found to have Mo concentration around 3%;
        this composite is recommended for use in the first physical prototype of a MMW heat exchanger.</p>

    <h3>Major Qualifying Project (MQP)</h3>
    <p><strong>Improving Employer Outcomes: Supervised Learning to Predict 
        Hiring Success</strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em></p>
    <p>The Career Development Center (CDC) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) 
        is an office which provides students with resources and services to assist 
        students in finding a career path after graduation, which includes connecting 
        employers and students. As such, they wish to understand what activities are 
        most influential to a company's success in hiring talent from WPI. Our team 
        analyzed data provided by the CDC about online job postings, on-campus 
        interviews, information sessions, and career fair attendance along with 
        information about student outcomes after graduation to determine what 
        contributed most significantly to employers' success. Because we wanted to 
        be "fair" to companies in our predictions, we decided to minimize mean squared 
        relative (percent) error, rather than traditional mean squared error. This 
        required us to develop a regression tree completely from scratch to then use 
        in random forest regression.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP)</h3>
    <p><strong>An Exploration in Predicting the Price of A Stock</strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em></p>
    <p>Mastering the art of the stock market is a goal of many, but none have a 
        perfect model to fit its chaotic nature. In this project, we explored 
        different methods of modeling the stock market to predict future stock 
        prices and examined how to measure stock volatility to gain more accurate 
        predictions. In addition, our stock portfolios made between an 8% and 39% 
        profit. We believe our model can help investors choose profitable stocks 
        like we did in our portfolios.</p>
