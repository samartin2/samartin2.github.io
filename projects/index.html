    <h3>Major Qualifying Project (MQP)</h3>
    <p><strong>Improving Employer Outcomes: Supervised Learning to Predict 
        Hiring Success</strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em></p>
    <p>The Career Development Center (CDC) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) 
        is an office which provides students with resources and services to assist 
        students in finding a career path after graduation, which includes connecting 
        employers and students. As such, they wish to understand what activities are 
        most influential to a company's success in hiring talent from WPI. Our team 
        analyzed data provided by the CDC about online job postings, on-campus 
        interviews, information sessions, and career fair attendance along with 
        information about student outcomes after graduation to determine what 
        contributed most significantly to employers' success. Because we wanted to 
        be "fair" to companies in our predictions, we decided to minimize mean squared 
        relative (percent) error, rather than traditional mean squared error. This 
        required us to develop a regression tree completely from scratch to then use 
        in random forest regression.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP)</h3>
    <p><strong>An Exploration in Predicting the Price of A Stock</strong></p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em></p>
    <p>Mastering the art of the stock market is a goal of many, but none have a 
        perfect model to fit its chaotic nature. In this project, we explored 
        different methods of modeling the stock market to predict future stock 
        prices and examined how to measure stock volatility to gain more accurate 
        predictions. In addition, our stock portfolios made between an 8% and 39% 
        profit. We believe our model can help investors choose profitable stocks 
        like we did in our portfolios.</p>
